This task had 3 subtasks.

1. Coursera Crash course on python by Google -
 
 This course taught the basics of programming in python and served as a good resource for quick revision of strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples etc.
 The word cloud project was implemented using jupyter notebook and the text file taken from Project Gutenberg.
 The following modules were used- wordcloud, numpy, matplotlib, IPython.display, fileupload, io, sys
 For the calculate_frequencies function, first the text was converted into into list of words. 
 Next, the punctuation marks and the uninteresting words were filtered out followed by the calculation of words stored in a dictionary format.
 Finally, the wordcloud was generated.

2. Mini Project(Tic Tac Toe Implementation using Python)-

 Module used - Pygame
 The initial colors, variables, fonts were declared.
 Next the display screen and the game board was created. The function to make marks 'X' and 'O' was enabled. 
 After that the condition for the game to end and the decision of the winner (X, O, Tie) was done.

3. Mini Project(Connect Four Implementation using Python)-
Module used - Numpy
Initial functions were defined to create and place the board markers, then to identify and classify a valid move.
Next the condition to check if the game was over was defined and who won the game(Player 1/ Player 2/ Tie).
Game input for player 1 and player 2 was defined through keyboard input from 1 to 7.
The main loop was thus implemented.
